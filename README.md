Line port Anagram Attack from Flash ActionScript 3 to Unity 5.

A literal port of data types, so used ArrayList and Hashtable, instead of List and Dictionary.  Then used my repo as2cs to convert model and levels.

Flash compared to Unity

My preference for game prototyping productivity:

Flash:  2D.
Unity:  3D.



Unity:

+ Free for non-commercial use.
+ 3D.
+ A lot of people make games in Unity.
+ Faster graphics rendering.
+ Inspect and edit during play.
+ Powerfully animate nested objects.
+ Publish WebGL starting as small as 5.5 MB.

Flash:

+ Installed in every major browser.
+ Publish SWF starting as small as 4 KB.
+ Rename, reorganize, replace nodes and animations still work.
+ Share a library symbol anywhere and automatically update it.
+ Conveniently preview and customize text, buttons, images, animations.
+ Draw images in the editor.
+ Compress vector images.
+ Conveniently share source code in multiple projects.
+ On Windows, conveniently use another code editor.
+ Easily program a button.
+ Copy and paste keyframes.
+ Default keyframe interpolation is linear.
+ Minimal need to wire in the editor:  Root class linkages.
+ Same coordinates for buttons and other objects.
+ Descendents of objects conveniently capture button presses on listeners.
+ Crisp fonts on all devices.
+ Exact layout on all devices.
+ Deploy to Android in 15 seconds, iOS in 1 minute, without third-party tools.



Unity Android gotcha:

Unity 5.3.4f1.  Windows 10.  Android build tools 24.
Android failed to build.
After downgrading Android build tools to 23, Android built.
