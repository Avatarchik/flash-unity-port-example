Line port Anagram Attack from Flash ActionScript 3 to Unity 5.

A literal port of data types, so used ArrayList and Hashtable, instead of List and Dictionary.  Then used my repo as2cs to convert model and levels.

Flash compared to Unity

My preference for game prototyping productivity:

Flash:  2D.
Unity:  3D.



Unity:

+ Free for non-commercial use.
+ 3D.
+ A lot of people make games in Unity.
+ Faster graphics rendering.
+ Inspect and edit during play.
+ Powerfully animate nested objects.



Flash:

+ Rename, reorganize, replace nodes and animations still work.
+ Share a library symbol anywhere and automatically update it.
+ Conveniently preview and customize text, buttons, images, animations.
+ Copy and paste keyframes.
+ Default keyframe interpolation is linear.
+ Draw images in place.
+ Compress vector images.
+ Conveniently share source code in multiple projects.
+ On Windows, conveniently use another code editor.
+ Easily program a button.
+ Minimal need to wire in the editor:  Root class linkages.
+ Any display object is conveniently animated.
+ No special cases for buttons or other objects.
+ Descendents of objects conveniently capture button presses on listeners.
+ Conveniently stop animations when they finish.
+ Crisp fonts on all devices.
+ Exact layout on all devices.
