Line port Anagram Attack from Flash ActionScript 3 to Unity 5.

A literal port of data types, so used ArrayList and Hashtable, instead of List and Dictionary.

Original weekend game jam in Flash:

Flash compared to Unity

My preference for game prototyping productivity:

Flash:  2D.
Unity:  3D.



Unity:

+ Free.
+ 3D.
+ A lot of people make games in Unity.
+ Optimized graphics rendering.
+ Inspect and edit during play.
+ Powerfully animate nested objects.



Flash:

+ Rename, reorganize, replace nodes and animations still work.
+ Share a library symbol anywhere and automatically update it.
+ Conveniently preview and customize text, buttons, images, animations.
+ Copy and paste keyframes.
+ Default keyframe interpolation is linear.
+ Draw images in place.
+ Compress vector images.
+ Conveniently share source code in multiple projects.
+ On Windows, conveniently use another code editor.
+ Easily program a button.
+ Minimal need to wire in the editor:  Root class linkages.
+ Any display object is conveniently animated.
+ No special cases for buttons or other objects.
+ Descendents of objects conveniently capture button presses on listeners.
+ Conveniently stop animations when they finish.
+ Crisp fonts on all devices.
+ Exact layout on all devices.
