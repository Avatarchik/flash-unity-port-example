Linguistic Effects on Anagram Solution:   The Case of a Transparent Language  Menelaos E. Sarris1,* & Chris T.

Tel: 30-2610-997-907. E-mail: m.sarris@upatras.gr  Received: July 12, 2013        Accepted: July 22, 2013        Online Published: August 4, 2013 doi:10.5430/wje.v3n4p41       URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.5430/wje.v3n4p41  Abstract Anagram solution tasks have been frequently used to assess word recognition processes and relevant research suggests that anagram solution ability is closely related to reading. Recently, the anagram paradigm was utilized to compare reading performance in the Greek language and was found to share significant positive correlation to reading fluency. The aim of the present study is to explore theoretical views with regard to the linguistic effects on solving anagrams in a transparent language with a simple syllabic structure, using custom made software. Results from 76 children illustrate that anagram solution difﬁculty is influenced by both syllable complexity and grapheme frequency. These variables also explain much of the variation in terms of the number of moves required for solution and the time spent working on anagrams.

Results showed that Scrabble players were better and faster at the task, which came as no surprise. But the researchers also learned that Scrabble players use a different part of the brain for the exercise. Study co-author Sophia Van Hees summarized the finding to CBC reporter Sarah Lawrynuik:

So typically, for non-experts, we’re recruiting the language area of our brain. Whereas when we do the task with Scrabble experts, they’re not really using the language network like average people. They’re actually recruiting areas that are more associated with visual processing and working memory. So they’re doing the task quite differently.
Here’s how the researchers described the finding in their study:

Results showed that when engaged in the lexical decision task (LDT), Scrabble experts made use of brain regions not generally associated with meaning retrieval in visual word recognition, but rather those associated with working memory and visual perception. The analysis of resting-state data also showed group differences, such that a different network of brain regions was associated with higher levels of Scrabble-related skill in experts than in controls [i.e. non-Scrabble players].
Van Hees says that this finding points to the brain’s flexibility, and suggests that we can use different areas of the brain to do similar tasks. The researchers are hopeful that their research can be used to help people with neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s. By using brain training exercises—Scrabble included—alternative parts of a person’s brain could conceivably be leveraged.

Subjects are presented, either visually or auditorily, with a mixture of words and logatomes or pseudowords (nonsense strings that respect the phonotactic rules of a language, like trud in English). Their task is to indicate, usually with a button-press, whether the presented stimulus is a word or not.

The analysis is based on the reaction times (and, secondarily, the error rates) for the various conditions for which the words (or the pseudowords) differ

Superiority of variable to repeated practice
in transfer on anagram solution

Previous research in motor learning shows that practicing variations of a task (variable practice) leads to better
transfer than does repeatedly practicing the exact same task (repeated practice). In contrast, research on priming
using verbal materials shows that performance on a test improves to the extent that the material at learning and test
overlap. We tested whether variability in practice conditions can lead to improved performance with the verbal priming
task of anagram solution. Participants practiced solving anagrams, either repeatedly solving the same anagram
that was later tested, repeatedly solving a different anagram from the one that was later tested, or solving different
variations of the anagram that was later tested. We found that this last condition—variable practice on different versions
of an anagram—led to improved test performance in relation to repeated practice, even when the test anagram
was the one that had been repeatedly practiced. This finding aligns results from the motor learning literature with a
higher level cognitive task: anagram solution. Shea and Kohl’s (1991) hypothesis, arguing that varied practice may
lead to greater elaborative processing than does repeated practice, provides one account of the results

Reading and Phonological Awareness

The Bananagrams game invites children to spell, read and sound out the words they have just created. They are also encouraged to read and check the other players words. Thus, this game enables children to practice and self-correct their own reading and writing, and add to their vocabulary by learning from their fellow players.
