Jennifer Russ played on Nexus 5 through 529 letters getting stuck, and again through 778 letters before wrapping around.

Word 2002.  O my god, so many letters.
Word 2126.  Level up slower?
Word 2356 of 2368.  Next word.  Wrap to other side.

To level up slower could consider:
	how many levels from the top
	lowest point of the word
	time on a word
Expected letter tapped was the letter selected.
Beats the game.  Expects to see she won.
Game over.  Likes that can continue to enter.  Hard to enter when overlapping delete or submit button.
Expected to not select a different letter by accident.
Expects fair word.  
	Partially sort anagrams by word frequency.  (example:  stoure)
Once a word was repeated.
